# PrimeNumbers
1. How to run it:
It's a console application so run it and input a whole number > 0 to generate a grid of prime numbers and their multiplications.
The result should be outputted in the screen.

2. It's been a while since I've done an end to end application so that felt good! 

3. If I had more time, I would revise a bit more the class hierarchy and necessity for all of them. Also change the output as output in the screen is not scalable and testable.
